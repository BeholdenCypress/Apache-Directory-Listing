# Apache-directory-listing
`Apache directory listing` is a theme inspired from [Apaxy](https://github.com/AdamWhitcroft/Apaxy) which uses Apache's `mod_autoindex` module.  

# Installation
* Download and copy all the files of directory-listing folder to any folder in the server(root directory is highly preferred).
* Copy any one of the `.htaccess` from either the 'grid' or 'table' folder to the root directory.
* Open the `.htaccess` file and replace `{SOME_FOLDER}` to the location of folder that you copied the files.  

# Themes
The theme is included with two css files for grid(grid.css) and normal(row.css) table styled indexing.  
Just use any one of the .htaccess file from the 'grid' folder or 'table' folder.  
You can add your custom code in the `header.html` and `footer.html`.
